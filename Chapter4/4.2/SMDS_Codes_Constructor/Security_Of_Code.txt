The original matrix is 
   8    9   12 
   0   11    2 
   5    2   13 
  10   11    1 
   3   11    6 

The required field size is GF(16)
Row=5, Multicast capacity h=Column=3
u=1: Satisfied!,C(5,1)=5 different combinations have been tested.

However, when u=2, some meaningful information leaks.
There are C(5,2)=10 different combinations, when we proceed to the 2-th combination, some meaningful information leaks.

This combination of vectors doesn't satisfy the condition of 2-secure network codes
1 3 
These row vectors will form a matrix shown as follows.
   8    9   12 
   5    2   13 

This matrix can be translated into the following matrix after elementary row transformation.
   8    0    0 
   0    8    6 

There is a vector with only one non-zero element in the new matrix, which implies that the eavesdropper can obtain some meaningful information.Therefore, the network codes constructed by this generator matrix only satisfy the condition of 1-secure network codes.
