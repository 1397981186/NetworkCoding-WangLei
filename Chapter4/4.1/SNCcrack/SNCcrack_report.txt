The original matrix is
85	47	52	52	
11	100	25	63	

After elementary transformations of matrix, the new matrix is
85	0	230	88	
0	245	58	28	

Secure! From the matrix above, we know that the eavesdropper  could  not obtain any original packets since there is no row vector in which there is only one nonzero element. And this implies that the associated data must not be original data.
